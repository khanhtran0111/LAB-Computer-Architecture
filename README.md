This is a repository containing two lab assignments from the course. Lab 2 focuses on writing a report about `caching`, while Lab 3 involves writing a report on `multithreading`. Both lab assignments were completed following the guidance of Professor **Nguyễn Ngọc Hoá** and teaching assistant **Nguyễn Đức Anh**.

Lab 1 is about benchmarking an Intel CPU, but since the configuration I used is AMD, I completed this lab together with my group mate.

Thank you for reading my repository.
